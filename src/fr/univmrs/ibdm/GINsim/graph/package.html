	what is a graph ?
	this set of abstract classes should give you an idea, it defines:
	<ul>
		<li>the graph manager: an abstraction of the backend used to store the graph (ie jgraph/jgrapht)</li>
		<li>The graph itself: what a specialised graph has to offer</li>
		<li>The graph descriptor: used to register a graph in the application, it offers the "know how" to open a new graph...</li>
	</ul>
