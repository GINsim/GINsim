for more info see http://ginsim.org


COMPILE AND INSTALL
-----------------------------------------------

GINsim uses maven: "mvn package" will compile it and prepare a jar
as well as dependancies into the target folder.
To use it outside of the build dir, copy the jar and the lib folder.


DOC
-----------------------------------------------

User documentation is available separately anc can be found on GINsim website.

Generate javadoc (in the "target/site" folder) using "mvn javadoc:javadoc".
	

RUN
-----------------------------------------------

Run GINsim using the "java -jar GINsim.jar" command.

  
PLUGINS
-----------------------------------------------

Most features in GINsim are implemented as plugins and declared using java annotations.
See the developer documentation for more details.
Note that out-of-tree plugins (i.e. plugins distributed as separate jar files) are not
supported, but supporting such plugins should be easy if needed.
