WHAT IS GINsim ?

GIMsim stands for Gene Interaction Networks simulation.
for more info see http://gin.univ-mrs.fr/GINsim/

-----------------------------------------------
COMPILE AND INSTALL

to compile ginsim just run ant in this directory.
it will create a dist dir containing everything necessary to run ginsim.

NOTE: do _NOT_ try to run runginsim in the compil directory, you have to use the start script found in the dist directory.
on windows platform you 'll have to ENTER the dist directory before

you can copy this dir anywhere you want, change it's name...

PS: if you don't have ant installed you can find it here: http://ant.apache.org/

PPS: if you want to run the .bat runner from within another directory, you may want to
		correctly set the GINSIM_DIR environement variable in the .bat

-----------------------------------------------
DOC

* docbook:
	ginsim has some doc in docbook format, to transform it to human readable format just run "ant docbook"
	you may need to change the path to docbooc-xsl, if you don't have it, just go to http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/xsl/
	and download it.
* javadoc:
	to generate ginsim's javadoc just run "ant javadoc"
* both:
	to generate both the javadoc and the docbook one, just run "ant doc"
	
note: all generated doc is placed in the dist directory under the doc subdir.


-----------------------------------------------
RUN

the "dist" dir contains startup scripts to run ginsim:
  * runginsim.sh: for UNIX/linux/MacOSX
  * runginsim.bat: for windows

  just run it and voila.

  NOTE: on windows platform you will have to ENTER the "dist" directory first
